# StealthNote

StealthNote is a Swift app that allows you to write notes and share them via email without looking at the screen.

I use it to gather ideas when falling asleep but it can be useful for writing messages from your pocket or for people with disabilities.

It uses the [graffiti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti_%28Palm_OS%29) system to recognize hand written letters.
