# StealthNote

StealthNote is a Swift app that allows you to write notes and send emails to predefined recipients without looking at the screen.

I use it to gather ideas when falling asleep but it can be useful for writing messages from your pocket or for people with disabilities.

It uses the [graffiti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti_%28Palm_OS%29) system to recognize hand written letters.

To be truely stealth and always be ready for input, options include:
 - dark theme
 - prevent auto-lock
 - customizing the recipients

This app can be found on the App Store [here]()
